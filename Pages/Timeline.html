                  <p>
                    At Fifteen, I started to indulge in three-dimensional modelling which made me curious towards the process of breaking down and manipulating tasks better to understand them, this process, I feel has heavily complemented my creativity alongside problem-solving. I began through the software Blender, it being free and open-sourced appealed to me and allowed me endless possibilities, on top of finding web services such as Cgtrader, which acted as a middleman in my system, helping me sell my products and models which further boosted my passion for arts and huger for money. 
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I learned from an early age how to manage myself, and more challengingly, how to take care of funds and deal with clients. While I experimented in an environment where I quickly was fulfilling the role of not only teaching how to use my products and models but to showcase them in a way that was appealing to the market that at the time wasnâ€™t saturated in the slightest. This then led to a quick mindset of constant self-analysis and development over my work which I feel has laid a prominent foundation in my thinking.
