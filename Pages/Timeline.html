                  <p>
                    At Fifteen, I spent my summer exploring indulging in three-dimensional modelling which made me curious towards the process of breaking down and manipulating tasks better to understand them, this process, I feel has heavily complemented my creativity alongside problem-solving. I began through the software Blender, it being free and open-sourced appealed to me and allowed me endless possibilities, on top of finding web services such as <a href="https://www.cgtrader.com/" class="link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cgtrader</a>, which acted as a middleman in my system, helping me sell my products and models which further boosted my passion for arts and hunger for money. 
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I learned from an early age how to manage myself, and more challengingly, how to take care of funds and deal with clients. While I experimented in an environment where I quickly was fulfilling the role of not only teaching how to use my products and models but to showcase them in a way that was appealing to the market that at the time wasnâ€™t saturated in the slightest. This then led to a quick mindset of constant self-analysis and development over my work which I feel has laid a prominent foundation in my thinking.

                <h3>PS5 Web Automation</h3>
                <p>
                    While still attending high school, I miraculously, unknowingly formed a strong connection towards computing through a client I found on social media. After replying to a post they made about a python job they needed help with, I managed to lay an agreement on a script to fully automate his process of buying a product for them to later make a profit on, after agreeing on a price, I eventually managed to create a script in a week while still attending school to make back what I made in a month from Cgtrader. 
                    <br><br>
                    In more detail, I managed to utilize my previous foundation in Python to begin creating what it seems now, quite a sophisticated automation bot. To assist me in this, I began getting familiar with tools such as <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/" class="link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Selenium</a> that helped me control the web aspect of the automation which alongside targeting the XPath of classes, I could control actions and directions. This current stage of web automation is very cheap and basic and very common in this community, but at the time, I wanted to push myself due to the pure enjoyment of what I was doing, in doing so, I managed to work on allowing the bot to run every hour of the day, every day.
                    <br><br>
                    To do this, I began working on bot detection bypassing, which included a handful of methods used such as the introduction of random paused which worked quite a bit on most websites but to push this more I began learning about IP address reputation. This was a major road bump, but to easily not get flagged on a website's system, changing the bots IP through a rotation system was as simple as connecting a Virtual Private Network into my system using this alongside the pausing feature. At the end of this, I managed to create a <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-series-x-and-ps5-scalper-bots-arent-illegal-but-they-soon-could-be-4121955#:~:text=soon%20could%20be-,Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20PS5%20scalper%20bots%20aren't%20illegal,but%20they%20soon%20could%20be" class="link" rel="noopener noreferrer"target="_blank">legal</a>, undetectable automation bot that could perform multiple purchases of the Playstaion-5 console when the stock had been refilled.

                <h3>E-commerce, Gogatsu</h3>
                <p>
                  With my experience and understanding of clients from Cgtrader and knowledge in websties from the Web-automation, I wanted to experiment with managing a business on my own. This included understanding the mechanisms of creating a store including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Search Engine Optimisations, to even understanding the inner workings of a domain DNS with security, alongside managing the physical layer of a business. 
                  <br><br>
                  This involved understanding stock and processing it through delivery systems, managing purchases and dealing with advertising to a level that included several platforms including, google ads, social media influencer marketing and even creating specialised social media accounts based on my physical products to further boost a community around this e-commerce store. 
                  <br><br>
                  In more detail, Gogatsu was a teenager-oriented and demographic-focused clothing brand, which showcased related products such as shoes, posters, mobile device cases and even manga books. This business idea was at the time a very rough cut of what I imagined due to restrictions in my skillset and experience before running a business. This was also heightened by the raw amount of roads closed that appeared one after another such as age validation coming from ads or services which was seen more compared to the previous business endeavours faced, although most were easily avoided by parental assistance. 
                  <br><br>
                  Surprisingly, fortunately for Gogatsu, it managed to gain a large following and website traffic alongside multiple orders being taken in weekly, although this was good, compared to previous freelancing jobs, particularly Web automation, I found the money on top of constant work including processing product profits and upselling prices to barely make a net profit resulted in me deciding to void the system, fortunately, me leaving with valuable knowledge on advertising, web development and more.
